## implementation Detals
    tokens contain the '  character when it is included between letters
    other than that the Tokenization rules are followed exactly
    
    The BST stores nodes as expected. left subtrees being smaller than middle, right subtrees being bigger
    The Priority Queue uses a vector to store TreeNode* 
     
    I did not implement a feature to shuffle the input for the BST
    
    the TreeNode.hpp file is based on the one from lab 06, with some modifications to work in this project.
    the structure for the huffman tree, priority queue, and the BST are all based on the recommended files
    provided in the class.
## Testing and Status
   I tested using the provided scripts and each one matched. so the current status is working as expected.
